# Your CV looks like sh*t - Easy fixes for typographic redemption
A practical and opinionated guide to CV typography and layout for developers, helping your resume survive human eyes.

---
Dear job-hunting developers and other non-designers,
Unbelievable as it may sound, out of 100 CVs you submit, 2 or 3 of them slip past an ATS and land in front of a pair of real, human eyes - if only for a fraction of a minute. That's when your carefully crafted professional profile must measure against the outdated multimodal biological intelligence running most HR brains.
And that worries me, because I have seen many of your LaTeX creations and template customizations. While they might have given you the necessary push over Greenhouse and Workday fences, their lack of presentational elegance could now be your undoing.
### Vibing right in the age of vibe-recruiting
Remember in-person interviews? Content has always been king, but like it or not, your _style_ (or _vibe_) was a factor.
I’m not talking about grooming, clothing, and cologne. Some of my best friends are back-end developers. What I’m talking about is your _voice_ (your tone, cadence, volume), which conveyed your thoughts more clearly and made your answers more memorable. That’s what we can call _vibes_.

Making it all the way to an interview is a bit too ambitious for the modern job market. Vibes are checked way earlier, by a professional category who I will not humorously generalize here (lest I ruin my chances of networking via this content). Let’s just say that if you want to motivate someone who’s got a thousand suitors for a single (real or fake) vacancy to actually read your CV rather than just look at it, you need to stand out.
### Sharing hard rules and opinions
That’s what I’ll do, if you’ll let me: I’ll give you some basic typographic and design tips that will make your résumé shine amongst the sea of samey Awesome-CV forks inundating the recruiter’s inbox (I promise a dedicated rant on the Awesome-CV template hyperinflation at a later date). No one expects you to start pumping out breathtaking custom designs, but elevating a serviceable template to typographic decency is a desirable, achievable feat for anyone.

Many of these tips are hard rules you should follow. While I'm not the ultimate authority on the topic—typography hasn’t been my hyperfixation since my London College of Printing days—ignoring most of what I’m about to tell you requires either a typographic superstar who knows exactly what they’re doing, or a berserker. I’ll assume you’re neither.
Some tips will fall under “just my opinions”: I'll politely welcome and smugly dismiss differing points of view.
(Really just kidding: I’m out here for constructive confrontations. Please share with me any take you have!)

# Jump in the line, or: Alignment basics
It’s hard to pick which principle deserves the number one spot, so I’ll start with the one that pushed me over the I-need-to-write-a-guide-about-this edge:
## Do not justify any text. Ever.
Like everything else I’ll beg you to avoid, justification has its place. This one’s is in long-form print. Combined with hyphenation, it can save a bit of paper across an entire book, create tidy blocky full-width paragraphs, or draw straight lateral borders clearly signaling a columnar layout.
You’re not writing descriptive essays for your work experiences, nor newspaper op-eds for your professional summary—and if you are, you definitely shouldn’t.
On your 1–2 page CV, justified alignment (especially without manual hyphenation and with large fonts) forces your editor to wildly vary letter-spacing across lines, disrupting the natural rhythm we follow to scan text. You don’t want to throw your recruiter off their groove in the one brief dance they’ve granted you.

On that matter:
## Leave hyphens to the typesetters
Again, we’re not trying to cut down from 400 to 396 pages. We’re trying to present crisp, discoverable keywords and nuggets of information. Sawing them in half and scattering their remains across the opposite sides of the page does not serve the purpose.
If you’ve worked as a _Data Analyst_ and the line doesn’t have room for the last three letters, you might actually stop a recruiter in their tracks to *some* effect. In every other case, two distant halves of a keyword won't make a whole one to a skimming eye.

But most importantly:
## Left-align everything
Reading (especially a recruiter’s gist-reading) is a dance. It’s not just about rhythm, but take that away and onlookers will squint their eyes or look away.
I know what you're thinking: no harm done in centering your name—and your contact info, while you're at it. But that's just your gateway drug to centering section titles and who-knows-what-else. I wish I could trust you with this, but I’ve seen good friends center-align entire paragraphs, and I don’t want your family to go through that.

Your reader’s eyes move like a typewriter: at the end of each line, they want to snap reliably to the same x-coordinate for the next. Otherwise, you’ll mess up their groove.

I'm sure you’re having none of these issues while reading your own centered content because you know it intimately, you’ve written it, you’ve read it 100 times. Here’s a shocker: you’re not really reading. Your brain is just filling in the gaps while your eyes bounce around (which is why proofreaders and writers are separate entities).

This x-axis principle is good for almost everything, and that’s why you should:
## Same stuff, same x
Here's the exception: your contact info. Those are short strings that would leave a whole lot of emptiness if stacked vertically. You definitely _can_ horizontally align them in a two-column layout, but you’re otherwise excused.

For everything else: if it’s on the same hierarchy level, it should sit at the same distance from the left margin. The one remaining troublemaker will be your employment dates, which I’m guessing you’ve placed on the same line as your job title or employer. Depending on your layout, they’ll often look cleaner either left-aligned as far right as they can go or properly separated using a right-aligned tab stop.

# To fear and to embrace the void (all the way to the dreaded second page)
You’ve heard designers talk about negative or white space. Sure, you can have too much of it, but a lack of it is what truly hurts.
## Don't mess with a document's margin
You’re likely starting your CV from a template in Word, Docs, Pages, or Canva. Notice how every text element keeps a respectful distance from the page’s edges (with only occasional decorations daring to venture further).
### If you gaze long enough into an abyss...
It looks like wasted real estate. Stare at it long enough, and it will call to you. The voices of a thousand influencers warning that a two-page CV is toilet paper will echo through that white space as you debate which bullet point to cut. You’ll feel tempted to nudge your name higher or let your main text box claim some lateral territory. Just **don't**.
### Mind the gap
When text hugs the edges, readers feel the anxiety of walking alongside a cliff. How close is too close? If you’re asking, you’re already planning to get too close. Avoid the debate and let the default margins stand for now.

If you’re doing LaTeX shenanigans, it’s up to you to set boundaries. Try roleplaying as a UX designer: print your document and see if you can hold it comfortably without your thumbs covering any text, and check if there’s room to jot notes around the edges with a marker. That’s probably what those still-printing-docs-in-2025 recruiters are doing, so you’d better accommodate them.
## Choose one or (if you really must, but you really don't) two types of separators
You’ve got sections: Education, Work Experience, maybe a Professional Summary, Skills, Languages, and Personal Interests. Someone should probably stop you before you list your middle school grades and favorite pets, but I promised not to meddle with content affairs.

Even the most minimalist applicant must decide how to separate sections. Properly styled titles help (more on that later), but outside text I count the following three available tools: spacing, dividers, and background shading.
I'm telling you now: you can only have two, and spacing is non-negotiable.
### Spacing plus one
To borrow a design cliché: _less is more_. "Less" prevents the claustrophobia we're trying to avoid with the mandatory spacing, and it also means "less stuff to maintain". Manually adjusting a bunch of dividers every time you tweak a bullet point stops being fun extremely fast. A row of underscores just replaces that issue with an unsightly hack.

So: spacing, plus maybe one between dividers and background shading. Just remember that most divider styles recall the last century in a non-flattering way, and background shading introduces a plethora of contrast, harmony, and spacing issues that no one wants to get into.
## No orphans nor widows
### Explaining an unfortunate metaphor
I’m skipping witty remarks about familial deaths here.
"Orphans" and "widows" are (disproportionately unpleasant) typographic concepts referring to lonely words, breaking the flow of their otherwise cohesive body of text. More specifically:
- An orphan is the last word of a sentence stranded alone on a new line.
- A widow is the last line of a paragraph left dangling at the top of a new page or column.
Both are bad. White space should signal section breaks, and that's what orphans and widows look like. Additionally, when a reader's eyes hop to a new line in the middle of a sentence, their momentum expects a worthy continuation, not an abrupt end. They'll stumble reading it and it won't feel great.
### How to fix it
Without going through all seven stages of grief, I'll reassure you: orphans and widows happen, but they're fixable.

Orphans are easier. Find a shorter synonym or abbreviation for a word in the sentence, and the straggler should pop back up. If you've already reached maximum possible conciseness, you might cheat a bit by shaving just a few pixels off the lateral margins until that single orphan shifts back, now dangling just a hair over the ideal limits. This is extremely dangerous, as any number of lines in the document could be affected, creating more orphans than it fixes.
More safely, you can just embrace that additional line. In this case, expand that sentence by two or three words at least. Give that single word a bit of company. Revel in freedom of expression, unshackled by the harsh telegrammatic bullet point limitations of modern CVs.
The last resort—if you still feel like cheating while respecting the margin's sanctity—is the line break (shift+enter) before the orphan. You now have a two-word line, and since your text isn't justified, no one will notice this premature break.

Widows are trickier (this nomenclature only gets more awkward). CVs are usually so tightly packed and carefully worded that you might need to drop an entire bullet point to fix one.
That might be too big a sacrifice. So here’s your official pass to shave a bit off the bottom margin to pull that lonely line back where it belongs. Yes, margins remain sacred, but if you've read all the way here, you've earned this.
## To boldly go where no one has gone before (page #2)
You've worked hard to cram your experience, skills, and other info onto one tight page, because you've been told that most recruiters are Gen-Zers whose reels-fried brains would short-circuit at the sight of a page break. And now here I am, suggesting changes that will either have you yelling *SHORTER!* at ChatGPT for another week or have your résumé overflow onto page two.
### The case for breathing room
First of all, TikTok is all about scrolling. Should these tired stereotypes about recruiters be true... their muscle memory is already trained to move on to the next page.
Secondly, UX design is all about the severe limits of human cognition (doomscrollers or not)—limits that are better served by a properly spaced document, even at the cost of one cumbersome input.
_Brevity is the soul of wit_, as an English guy once said (and what does that say about me writing this wall of text?). But brevity is about content, not strictly form. I could fit *The Philosopher's Stone* on a flyer, but you wouldn't enjoy reading it.

Clear sections, skimmable dates, and skill lists that don’t require eye gymnastics do a far better job than a one-size-fits-all layout at making your CV accessible to overworked, distracted, much too human recruiters.

At the very least, it won't kill the vibe.

# Size, weight, color, and otherwise alarming classifiers outside typography
### Allow me to nerd out
A premise (due or not, I never miss a chance to get into this tirade): _font_ does not mean what you think it means. You're thinking of _typeface_.
In front-end terms: a typeface is a font-family; a font is a particular permutation of properties (size, weight, and style) for that family. Typeface: Inter. Font: Inter, bold, 12px.
Yes, I am fun at parties.

The following properties can be combined to concoct distinct styles. You don't need more than three or four styles in your CV, and even that might be a generous amount.
## Typefaces and fonts
### Strict borders on your playground
Most applicants have to accept a hard cap of just **one typeface**.
Bold adventurers might decide that their name and section titles are worthy of a display typeface. Alternatively, if you're equipped with taste, one for section titles and one for the rest. That's really it.
Use a third font-family in your CV, and you will be referred to a physician.

_One typeface_ doesn't mean _one font_, but we'd do well to go easy here too. Modern tools offer a dangerously vast choice of weights: you'll do well to limit yourself to just a couple—something around `Regular` and `Bold`.
### The best possible typeface for your CV is...
Sorry, I baited you. Sure, I think some typefaces are _objectively_ bad (both universally and for our context), but that's still my opinion dressed up as fact. I can dig up the 2,000 words I wrote about Comic Sans being better than Helvetica, if you want to test this claim.

That's the thing with typefaces: they surely create a vibe, but that vibe resonates differently depending on taste, exposure, and all sorts of personal baggage.
Sans-serifs generally feel clean and modern; serifs often classy and traditional. Then again, while you might appreciate Montserrat's simplicity and balance, I'd rather throw myself out a window if I see it again. You might find a Times New Roman mono-font résumé mature and confident; I might wonder if I've been handed a subpoena.

If you need a hard rule, here's the only one I can confidently give: don't use Wingdings.
## On sizes and weights
### No messing around
Leave that default size be. Maybe drop it by a point or two, depending on the typeface's base appearance and your content density.
Up next are job titles or company names—your choice, as long as this hierarchy is reflected by a bigger size and/or a heavier weight. Just avoid dramatic deltas.
Finally, section titles. With good enough spacing, you don't even need these to be much bigger than the job titles, if at all. With *stellar* spacing and structure, groupings would be so self-evident that section titles could even be considered redundant.

Above all, consistency. The style for company names under your Work Experience should match that of academic institutions under Education, as they are hierarchically the same.
## Bold
### To bold or not to bold...
Should you highlight keywords in bold? Few do, which vexes me. Although, if I were to indulge in overthinking (which I love), I'd concede it's a double-edged sword.
### The universal positives
It’s reasonable to assume an ATS has already scanned for relevant keywords. It’s just as likely that a recruiter will look for them, too, if only to get a sense of when and where each one applied.
Bold words are a skimmer's landmark, almost serving as faux-subtitles. If a recruiter takes 15 seconds to judge a CV, bolding's immense cognitive and time savings could make all the difference. You might even get a custom rejection email!
### The context-specific negative
Could such convenient and evident landing spots drive a recruiter to gist-read your CV even more gist-ly, thus failing to absorb the context in between? All we know is that they won't ever admit it.

What's certain is that overthinking doesn't really help after a certain point. So just remember this: **When everything is bold, nothing is.**
To give some real oomph to those bold words, pick just a couple **per experience** (not per line!), if not fewer. They will surely leave an impression.
## Color
### The overthinker special
No one will tell you this (because it's another overthought), but: set your page's background to white manually, especially in LaTeX. It may export transparent, and while any viewer will default to a white render, the day your CV gets embedded in a dark-themed page will be its last.
## Making it pop, not explode
You're looking to add some flavor to your CV, and after staring at all that black text for so long, it’s starting to taste stale. Do you need some color?
You're an adult, free to take any risk. Just, please:
- Use a contrast checker. If you need a reason for this, consider your color privileges revoked.
- Get a friend's sanity check. Some colors might contrast enough with your white background, while also offending common decency.
- One (1) color besides black.Again, it's about sustainable simplicity.
- Use it sparingly. Maybe your name (although I'd suggest only one of your first and last name). Maybe your section titles and/or job titles. Exercise absolute restraint after this.
## Understated and sensible
For some class and subtlety, try this: don't _really_ use color.
Instead, soften your white background (I suggest erring in the direction of yellow-ish rather than gray). Optionally, you might also tone down your black text. Be mindful not to go full sepia.
You now have a CV that is slightly less harsh on the recruiter's eyes than a standard #00 on #FF. They may not explicitly notice, but their eyes will sigh in relief when opening your file.

If it were up to me, I'd make all CVs dark-themed. Hell, I'd make them landscape. But rumor has it that they still print these things. If I ever manage to get a recruiter's reply, I'll let you know if that's true.

# The part where you DM me
I’ve already spilled 3,000 words on this, and I still have **too much** left to say. Letter spacing? Line height? All caps sins? Ideal size-to-leading ratios?
I could go on. Honestly, if I started covering every detail I think deserves attention, I’d end up writing a book. I'm that detail-oriented and knowledgeable. (Wink wink, recruiters. Hit me up).

While I clearly enjoy typing into the void, I do crave the occasional **human interaction**.  
So let’s do this.

**Job seekers**: If you need a quick look at your CV, let’s talk. I’ll point out the quick edits that’ll make it shine, and maybe we’ll even have a laugh. I promise I can keep it under 5 minutes if we’re chatting live (no such guarantees for written replies).

**Recruiters**: I’d love your feedback too. Or any sign that you actually exist, really. What catches your eye? What grinds your gears? Did I miss something, or get something very wrong?

Your CV deserves better. So does whoever has to read it.
